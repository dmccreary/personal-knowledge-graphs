The evolution of note and notes relationships Part 4: Integration Introduction to Integration Personal Knowledge Graphs can work fine on their own. But to gain real value to an organization we ask the question \"How do PKGs integrate with other systems within a large enterprise?\". The Integration Patterns Approach This section of the PKG book will focus on not just the integration features of one specific PKG tool, but it will introduce a general pattern language for approaching integration. For an excellent reference to the use of integration patterns we suggest the Enterprise Integration Patterns Book and Website . Interoperability Challenges with Markdown The native format of most PKGs is Markdown. But Markdown was not originally designed to store typed links between pages. This section describes the additions we need to make to Markdown syntax to support typed links. Importing Markdown into your PKG This section describes how you can take external Markdown files and import them into your PKG. We cover the key challenges and patterns to address import consistency. Exporting Markdown from your PKG Each PKG software system had different ways to export data. We discuss the key export patterns and discuss how they might evolve in the future. Integrating Flat Files - CSV and Spreadsheets In this section we will focus on the simplest form of integrating structured data into your PKG: the flat file. Flat files are both familiar and ubiquitous in large organizations. For simplicity, they are a great way to quickly get started. But they also have drawbacks. This section will cover both the pros and cons of integrating flat files, csv files and Spreadsheets into PKGs. Working with RDF RDF is a standard way of representing graph-structured knowledge that can be shared. In this section we will briefly describe RDF and the methods we use to import and export this format. Working with Labeled Property Graphs Labeled Property Graphs are a key method that large organizations store connected information. Working with Formal Taxonomies and Ontologies Many organizations start with simple flat business vocabularies. Working with SKOS SKOS is a universal way to represent glossaries, business vocabularies, taxonomies and ontologies. In this section we will review how SKOS data can be represented in PKGs. Integrating NLP Tools Large language model tools such as BERT and GPT have revolutionized concept editing. In this section we will review some of the ways that NLP tools can be integrated into PKGs. Integrating with Employee Data Your knowledge graph should be able to allow you to quickly reference individuals in your organization and your peer group. Your note taking should work with your \"autocomplete\" just like when you type \"to:\" or \"cc:\" in your email.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-personal-knowledge-graph-book","text":"","title":"Welcome to The Personal Knowledge Graph Book"},{"location":"#book-outline","text":"","title":"Book Outline"},{"location":"#part-1-introduction","text":"Why this book - the vision of an intelligent assistant The popularity of PKGs - why the second brain is useful, personal knowledge management The popularity of EKGs - central repositories of knowledge, the value of connected information The business value of connected information Business value of PKG-EKG integration Autocomplete, APIs and Data Formats The role of the Chief Knowledge Officer - integration without restricting creativity","title":"Part 1: Introduction"},{"location":"#part-2-key-concepts","text":"The Knowledge Triangle: Data, Information and Knowledge Note-taking and the power of Autocomplete - enabling the intelligent assistant SKOS Preferred labels Alternate labels Definitions Descriptions Rules Relationships Types Relationships Adding structure rules to a subgraph Registry vs. Repository Canonical Schemas","title":"Part 2: Key Concepts"},{"location":"#part-3-case-studies","text":"1 2 3 1.
