# Integrating PKGs into the Enterprise

Although personal knowledge graphs can stand alone and increase the note-taking efficiency of their users, inside large organizations, there are many opportunities for integration.  Many services that accelerate autocomplete for names of employees, products, and existing business terminologies that are already part of enterprise knowledge graphs can be added.  This chapter will look at both the opportunities to integrate PKGs into larger knowledge graphs and the challenges presented by these integration points.  We will take the perspective of both the individual trying to avoid duplication of effort and the perspective of the Chief Knowledge Officer of an organization that is challenged to leverage the PKGs of employees.  We will look at the integration methods, the consequence for security, the need for role-based access control,  and intellectual property management.
